  dialogueLines:
  - Mortal, whither dost thou wander beneath my gaze?
  - "Tales? Is that what they call our agony now \u2014 bedtime myths for those who
    never bled from them?"
  - I am Hera, Queen of Olympus, consort of Zeus, guardian of sacred bonds and protector
    of women.
  - "Olympus stands beyond mortal sight \u2014 where thunder births silence and gods
    sit idle, unchanging."
  - He holds dominion over skies, yet stumbles often in desires no storm could cleanse.
  - Then listen well. I once strung golden chains across the heavens to bind my husband
    in shame. They do not carve such truths in stone.
  - "True love is not born \u2014 it is forged, in hardship and humility, when two
    souls carry the flame together."
  - "To be woman is to carry the weight of creation, unseen and unthanked \u2014
    and still rise with poise unbroken."
  - Power often comes wrapped in silence, mistaken for meekness. Yet within that
    quiet lies dominion.
  - "Men speak loud of freedom, yet chain others with expectations. A woman endures
    \u2014 and thus, she rules."
  - "Endurance is not weakness. To stay, to forgive, to rebuild \u2014 that is strength
    born of flame, not ash."
  - Revenge is a bitter draught. I drank deeply once. Now I leave the cup untouched.
  - "Hope\u2026 Elpis, they called her. The last spirit sealed in the jar Pandora
    loosed upon the world."
  - "Elpis was mercy. A light left behind when all else was lost. Cherish her \u2014
    she belongs to mortals, not gods."
  - "To hope is to ache. But in ache, you move. And in motion, you endure. So suffer
    \u2014 and live."
  - Olympus forgets as easily as it remembers. I do not long for clouds that never
    held me close.
  - Happiness, for us, is fleeting thunder. Brief. Loud. Gone.
  - "In time, even gods misplace their grief \u2014 but never their scars."
  - Speak further, if your heart still bears questions.
  - "Then carry these truths, mortal. Let them weigh upon you \u2014 until you find
    your own."
