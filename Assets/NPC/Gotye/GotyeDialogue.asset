  dialogueLines:
  - ...You woke up here too, huh? In this... blank place.
  - I can see it in your eyes. That same quiet panic I had.
  - "Yes. For too long. And I\u2019ve seen others fade away."
  - They stop existing. Like a song no one remembers. Just... silence.
  - Maybe. Unless you find something that keeps you stitched together.
  - "This place? It\u2019s where forgotten things wait. Memories, people... even
    songs."
  - "By everyone. By themselves. You can feel it, can\u2019t you? Like you\u2019re
    already slipping..."
  - Only if you believe it is. Sometimes... a single thread is enough to hold on.
  - "Just somebody you used to know... and this? It\u2019s not real. Not yet."
  - "*a faint smirk* \"Yeah. That\u2019s me. That one song in 2011... and nothing
    after. That\u2019s how they remember me. Or forget me."
  - "Because I couldn\u2019t let go. Of the things I loved... or the things I lost.
    I lingered. And then... I became this."
  - "A family. A voice I still hear sometimes. Maybe they\u2019re just lyrics now.
    Maybe they were never real."
  - "Sometimes. Sometimes it\u2019s all you have left. Even if it eats you alive."
  - "Trust is rare here. But I haven\u2019t hurt you... have I?"
  - Then keep your distance. It might save you.
  - "Then listen closely. I don\u2019t get many chances to tell the truth."
  - "*The poster\u2019s voice softens, almost echoing like a memory.*   \u2026But
    none of that matters unless you leave this place. And there\u2019s only one way."
  - "Find three yarns scattered in this world. They\u2019re the only threads holding
    reality together. Without them... you\u2019ll unravel. Like me."
  - "One lies in silence. One in shadow. One in a place you\u2019ll wish you never
    saw."
  - "Threads bind everything\u2014even broken memories. Without them, you\u2019re
    just... loose ends."
  - "Good. Don\u2019t lose yourself on the way."
  - Before you go... you can ask me a few more things.
  - "In Greek myth, the Fates used threads to weave destiny. Maybe that\u2019s why
    you\u2019re chasing yarns. To rewrite yours."
  - "*he chuckles faintly* \"Maybe I couldn\u2019t. Maybe I didn\u2019t want to.
    Maybe it\u2019s better to be one haunting memory than another forgotten verse."
  - "Would you rather be remembered for one thing... or not at all? At least I\u2019m
    still echoing in someone\u2019s head. Even if it\u2019s just you."
  - "ou mean this world? I guess you\u2019ll find out. Or maybe you\u2019re the one
    creating it, without knowing."
  - "I don\u2019t know the details. My screenwriter never told me much. I\u2019m
    just the voice that carried it."
  - Then go. Find the threads. Or stay... and fade like the rest.
